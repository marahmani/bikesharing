In this project, Kate wants to see if creating the same idea of bike sharing that she had experienced in New York, would help her to propose an idea about Des Moines. There are a lot of differences between the two cities, as one is very big and popular and the other not as popular. Using Tableau will help a lot to create a very good visualization for the audience to make a better decision in this regard. 

There are a lot of factors to consider, such as the month that people are using the Bike Sharing and Gender of people and what locations are popular, and people use mostly. Where do people begin their ride and where do they drop them off.
We need to know when the peak usage hours in the month of August are. This might help with understanding the idea better for the Des Moines.
If we use a map, it will show the results better and will help visualize and understand the situation better based on the data gathered.

There are questions we can ask and by finding the answering them we have a better visualization. For example, the top locations to drop off the bike, the usage of the bike based on gender, finding the average trip duration based on age. By calculating these, we get a better idea and using Tableau we can show better visuals for the project proposal.
Please check the link above for the story of this project.

we conclude based on the results that:
1- Men have used way more than other two types of gender. 
2- All Genders have started their trip either early in the morning or between 5 to 6 pm.
3- Most users appear to be subscribers.
4- Most users started and end their trip in the middle of the city such as Manhhatan.
